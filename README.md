This project focuses on image classification using three prominent convolutional neural network architectures: AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet50, applied to the CIFAR-10 dataset. 
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, making it a standard benchmark for evaluating image classification models.

The project involves training each model on the CIFAR-10 training set and evaluating their performance on the test set. Key metrics such as accuracy, precision, and
recall are calculated to compare the effectiveness of each architecture. By leveraging the strengths of AlexNet's pioneering design,VGG16's deep structure, and ResNet50's residual
connections, this study aims to provide insights into their respective capabilities and efficiency in image classification tasks.
